For the past few years, I have been a perpetually busy person. I tend to spend a lot of time focusing (obsessing?) on
whatever task/project i'm trying to accomplish. This year, I started to focus my energy on my starting my own engineering
firm, [Rincon Strategies](http://rinconstrategies.io). I don't want be this busy all the time, but for now at least 
I am busy building my own company, rather than doing it for someone else.
<!-- more -->

I want Rincon Strategies to build amazing experiences for the web and mobile, but also bring strong engineering principles
to both of these areas. We have already built some amazing things in the short time we have been around, but there is more
to come!
