I just gave a talk last night about EcmaScript 6 (or ES2015) at our [TucsonJS](http://www.meetup.com/TucsonJS/) meetup. It was
a fun talk with great participation from the TucsonJS members. The slides can be found [here](http://charlesbking.com/power_of_es6).
I hope they make you as excited as I am to start using ES6. Enjoy!
