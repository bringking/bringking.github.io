    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, haven&rsquo;t posted on here in over a year. Well a lot has happened since then, so I thought I would update this post
to reflect some of the changes that I have been through. First off, I changed the stylesheets around significantly, to match the
style I am leaning towards now. Minimal, light and dark, only color where appropriate, etc. I am not done yet, so look
out for more changes. Professionally,  I jumped from doing app development on the side to full-time web-developer. Yayy!
It has been a tough year of fast paced development, but I think I am a better coder for it. So keeping that in mind,
some of my new post ideas will involve the things I am excited about now. Mainly <a href="http://www.knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a>,
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, NodeJS, and CoffeeScript (to name a few). I have some cool stuff to share so I hope you
enjoy.</p>
