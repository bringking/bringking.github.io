    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First post! I went all out and started an Octopress based blog.  This was partly just to challenge myself as Octopress is not your average
wordpress blog. However, if you are used to the command line and somewhat familiar with ruby or git, you will feel right at home. Check it out
<a href="http://octopress.org/">here</a>. The theme I am using <a href="https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash">Slash</a>. Anyways
why this blog? I wanted to provide a place for me to organize my thoughts and ramblings on programming,
working in IT and specifically working IT in non-desirable places, like a basement. So I don&rsquo;t know how much I will
have to say, however I will post as I learn new and cool things about my adventures in coding and/or life. Enjoy!</p>
