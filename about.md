I'm a father, husband, software engineer and an entrepreneur (in order of importance). I live and work in Tucson, AZ. I love writing code and working
on interesting problems. I started off in technology by supporting and creating applications for the desktop. Shortly afterwards, I fell in love with mobile
and created mobile applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. However, currently I am most interested in bringing
rich experiences the web using Javascript. I do as much stuff as I can on [Github](https://github.com/bringking) and
I am on Twitter as [@TheBringKing](https://twitter.com/TheBringKing).
